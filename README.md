# LiriBot

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a <em>Language</em> Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## Liri uses the following commands:
```
concert-this
movie-this
spotify-this-song
